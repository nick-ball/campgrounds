## Features Of The Web App

### Responsive Design
### Authentication:

User signup and login with username and password, as well as Admin login with admin username and password. Password is hashed securely on MongoDB database.

### Authorization:

A user cannot create new posts without being authenticated, and also a user cannot edit or delete existing posts and comments created by other users. There is an admin account that is the sole account to have unlimited CRUD permissions for every user post and comment on the app. This was a custom addition as well.

### Functionalities Of Posts & Comments:

Create, view, edit and delete posts and comments, upload campground photos from local storage, and display campground exact location on Google Maps. Also, flash messages responding to usersâ€™ interaction with the app.

### Custom Enhancements

Included Google APIs with developer account, used Google Fonts and Font Awesome resources instead of default font families, merged the comment show page into a single campground show page to be more user friendly, also included extensive UI customizations of the app. Furthermore, implemented creation and update timestamps for posts and comments. Dynamic pricing of campground posts was added.
